      <h1>A website by Ellie</h1>

      <p> When I first set out to make a website for personal use, I ended up not actually making a website. Then one day I found out that one can buy a URL with emojis in it. My first thought was, "boy, I sure could have some fun with this!" So I bought a url. This domain to be exact. I thought it was funny, but now I don't even know what to put on it. In the mean time, I will have this paragraph and some links to my other silly things.</p>
